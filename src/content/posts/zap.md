The need for media to efficiently provide information is increasing day by day in line with the ever-growing developer network.

### New age of the blog system

As the developer level increased, blog systems began to appear that could provide information faster, more concisely, and more efficiently. And the developer's blog has the following differences from the general service type blog.

- Code snippet feature
- Dark theme preferred
- Information interlocking preferred
- Attach a schematic image rather than a photo
- Prefer markdown input

Naturally, static blogging systems exclusively for developer blogs begin to emerge.

### Static page generation
