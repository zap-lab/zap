# Overview

## What is zap?

Zap is a fast, lightweight, developer-specific blog open source built on top of Gatsby. The principles for developing Zap are as follows.

- It should be incredibly fast, the content should load within the user's browser in 50ms.
- It should be aesthetic. Readability is the most important principle, and for this we aim for simple functionality and UI.
- All information in the Zap project should be accessible to anyone. This applies to everything including design, decision, and remaining tasks.
- It should be easy, easy to install, easy to contribute, and easy to use.
- It must be multi-platform compatible.
- It must conform to the Modern Web Specification. This includes PWA, AMP, a11y, and means to prefer video instead of gif, svg instead of png, icon font set instead of svg icon whenever possible.
